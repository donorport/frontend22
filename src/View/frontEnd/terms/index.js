                The Services Description: The Services are offered as a platform to allow a Charity
                or not-for profit organization (referred collectively hereafter as the "Organizer")
                to post a fundraiser ("Fundraiser Post") to the Platform to accept monetary
                donations ("Donations") from donors ("Donors") on behalf of the Organizer to
                purchase specific items required by the Organizer, as advertised in the Fundraiser
                Post.{' '}
              </p>
              <p>
                The Services are Platforms; We are not a Broker, Financial Institution, Creditor or
                Charity: The Services are administrative platforms only. Donorport facilitates the
                Fundraiser of the Organizers and permits Donors to make donations to these
                Fundraisers. Donorport is not a broker, agent, financial institution, creditor or
                nonprofit corporation.{' '}

                and hereby disclaims all liability in this regard to the fullest extent permitted by
                applicable law. We do not guarantee that a Fundraiser will obtain a certain amount
                of Donations or any Donations at all. We do not endorse any Fundraiser, User, or
                cause and we make no guarantee, express or implied, that any information provided
                through the Services is accurate. Donorport is not affiliated, nor does it endorse,
                any store or vendor whereby an Organizer purchases or procures its charitable items,
                which discretion remains solely in the hands of the Organizer. We expressly disclaim
                any liability or responsibility for the outcome or success of any Fundraiser. You,
                as a Donor, must make the final determination as to the value and appropriateness of
                contributing to any User or Fundraiser.

                Before making any decisions regarding any Fundraisers, Organizers, Donations,

                <u>No Solicitation:</u> The Platform is offered by Donorport only to provide the
                technology to allow Fundraisers to connect with Donors. The existence of the
                Services is not a solicitation of donations by Donorport, and Donorport does not
                engage in any solicitation activities, or consult on the solicitation of
                contributions from the public, on behalf of any individual, entity, or organization.
                By using the Services, you understand and agree that Donorport is not responsible
                for the use of your Donations or the amount of funds raised for the Organizer or
                Fundraiser.{' '}
              </p>
              <p>
                <u>No Advertising:</u> Donorport expressly disclaims any and all liability related
                to third-party advertisers and/or advertisements appearing on the Platform,
                including advertisements appearing on Fundraising Posts. Advertisements appearing on
                Fundraising Posts may have no affiliation or connection whatsoever with the
                Organizer of the Fundraising Post and/or the Fundraiser. Donorport, at its sole
                discretion, may place advertisements, whether related or unrelated to an Organizer,
                on an Organizer 's Fundraising Post. Donorport does not affiliate or endorse any

                <u>Payment Processor:</u> Donorport is not a payment processor and does not hold any
                funds. Instead, Donorport uses a third-party payment processing partner to process
                Donations for a Fundraiser ("Payment Processor"). You acknowledge and agree that the
                use of Payment Processors is integral to the Services and that we exchange
                information with Payment Processors in order to facilitate the provision of the
                Services. See our{' '}

              <p>
                <u>Display Price:</u> The price of an item shown on the Fundraising Post is an
                all-inclusive amount, representing the cost per unit of an item, as well as a
                regional sales tax as set by the charity and a transaction fee determined by the
                Payment Processor.{' '}
              </p>
              <p>
                <u>Transaction Fee:</u> Although there are no fees to start or maintain a
                Fundraiser, please keep in mind that a transaction fee, including credit and debit
                charges, and merchant fees are added to the unit price of each charitable item
                (hereinafter and on the website referred to as "Transaction Fee"). The Transaction
                fee is the exact amount charged by our Payment Processor to process the transaction.
                Donorport retains no part of the transaction fee. Any Transaction Fees exceeding the
                de facto cost of an item (inclusive of all of Transaction fees and tax) will be kept
                by the Organizer as an additional charitable donation. Transaction Fees paid by the
                Donor are not tax deductible and Tax Receipts will not be provided for the
                Transaction Fee.
              </p>
              <p>
                <u>Platform Fee:</u> Donorport includes a service charge paid for by the donor upon
                completion of each transaction and retains this amount from each transaction.
                (hereinafter and on the website referred to as "Platform Fee").
              </p>
              <p>
                <u>Tax Receipts:</u> If your organization is not a registered charity, the platform
                is still available for use. Please note, that donors of not-for-profits will not be
                able to issue a charity receipt, whereas donors to a registered charity may receive
                a tax receipt.{' '}

                If any provision of these Terms of Service is held invalid or unenforceable by a
                court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be modified to the extent
                necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable and the remaining provisions
                of these Terms of Service shall remain in effect and enforceable in accordance with
                their Terms of Service.{' '}

              <p>
                These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Donorport and
                govern your use of the Services, superseding any prior agreements between you and
                Donorport with respect to the Services. You also may be subject to additional terms
                of service that may apply when you use affiliate or third-party services,
                third-party content or third-party software. These Terms of Service will be governed
                by the federal laws of Canada/provincial laws of Ontario, without regard to its
                conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to
                arbitration, as set forth above, you and Donorport agree to submit to the personal
                and exclusive jurisdiction of the Ontario courts. The failure of Donorport to
                exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not
                constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of
                Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be (or are otherwise)
                invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give
                effect to the parties ' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other
                provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that
                regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action
                arising out of or related to use of the Services or these Terms of Service must be
                filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever
                barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic
                form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or
                relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as
                other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed
                form. You may not assign these Terms of Service without the prior written consent of
                Donorport, but Donorport may assign or transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or
                in part, without restriction. If we fail to enforce any of our rights, that does not
                result in a waiver of that right. The section titles in these Terms of Service are
                for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be
                made via email or regular mail. The Services may also provide notices to you of
                changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to
                notices generally on the Platform. Donorport may, at any time, assign our rights or
                delegate our obligations hereunder without notice to you in connection with a
                merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of equity or assets, or by operation of
                law or otherwise. Nothing in these Terms of Service shall prevent Donorport from
                complying with the law. Donorport shall not be liable for any delay or failure to
                perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not
                limited to, acts of God, war or threats of war, terrorism or threats of terrorism,

                <li>
                  A. An Organizer is required to purchase an item in the number of units set by the
                  Organizer (that does not exceed the advertised number of units available), once
                  payment is received from the Donor, for the full quantity stated at the unit rate
                  provided on the Organizer 's fundraising post;{' '}
                </li>
                <li>
                  B. An Organizer has an option not to specify the number of units that will be
                  purchased for items used by the Organizer on a regular basis (hereafter "Regular
                  Use Items"). Accordingly, where no number of units it specified in a Fundraising
                  Post in this situation, donations are automatically deposited into the Organizer
                  's account to purchase Regular Use Items at the Organizer 's sole discretion. The
                  Organizer may, at its sole discretion, post sales receipts for the purchase of
                  Regular Use Items and other information with respect thereto, as it sees fit.{' '}
                </li>
                <li>
                  C. If the total cost of the item(s), including all applicable Transaction fees and
                  legally applicable taxes, is less than the amount the Donor has paid to the
                  Organizer based on the number of units purchased, the Organizer will retain the
                  remaining funds as an additional donation.{' '}
                </li>
                <li>
                  D. If the total cost of the charitable units advertised in the Organizer 's post,
                  including Transaction fees and legal applicable taxes, exceeds the amount the
                  Organizer received from the donors from its Fundraising Post, the Organizer will
                  purchase as many units of the product as possible with the total funds received
                  from the corresponding post;{' '}
                </li>

                  already received, the Organizer will procure as many units of the item as possible
                  with the total funding received from the donors in regards to that Fundraising
                  Post;{' '}

                Entity, represent and warrant to Payment Processor and Donorport that such
                information is true and that you are authorized to use the applicable Withdrawing

                the Payment Processor pursuant to these Terms of Service as well as any and all
